B. For data type float, what lower bound on the CPE is determined by the
critical path?

(4+3)/3 = 2.3333
The lower bound on the CPE is determined by 2.3333 for data type float.

C. Assuming similar instruction sequences for the integer code as well, what lower bound on the CPE is determined by the critical path for integer data?

(3+1)/3 = 1.3333
The lower bound on the CPE is determined by 1.3333 for data type integer.

D. Explain how the two floating-point versions can have CPEs of 3.00, even
though the multiplication operation requires either 4 or 5 clock cycles.

according to the code :sum = sum +udata[i] * vdata[i],
Since the multiplication is not influence the other thread(multiplication first), we no need to wait the multiplication in the pipeline.Therefore whether multiplication either 4 or 5 clock cycles, the floating-point will not affect by multiplication. The CPEs always be 3.00.
